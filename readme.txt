Adds AJAX requests to Thematic navigation so you can navigate your site without full page refreshes. Only the content data is loaded. Uses jquery-pjax.

== Description ==

*Thematic PJAX* adds PJAX to the Thematic Theme Framework. [PJAX](http://pjax.heroku.com/) "loads html from your server into the current page without a full page load. It's AJAX with real permalinks, page titles, and a working back button that fully degrades." Browsing just "feels faster" and makes mixing and matching static with dynamic site elements a breeze. By default, PJAX loads content asynchronously within the `main` div, providing load once static functionality to the header and the footer.

Thematic PJAX is built on the work of the [Thematic Theme Framework](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/thematic), [pjax-menu](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pjax-menu/), and [jquery-pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax).
